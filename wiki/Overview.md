# Overview

ESP32-OTA-Update empowers developers with a ready-to-use library for implementing Over-The-Air updates on ESP32 devices. It abstracts the low-level OTA update procedure into a modular library so that you can focus on feature development rather than the intricacies of secure firmware deployment. The design leverages industry-standard protocols and best practices to ensure every update is safe and reliable.
